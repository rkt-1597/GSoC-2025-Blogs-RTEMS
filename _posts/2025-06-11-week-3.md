## Overview
-------------------------------
This week is the third week working with RTEMS as a GSoC Contributor. This week wholly lies in the Coding Period of GSoC. This week, I completed the following tasks :
+ Able to start GRETH Simulation in RTEMS-SIS Terminal
+ Continued coding for GRETH lwIP
+ Created Blog post for Week-3

## Work completed this week
----------------------------------

1. Able to start simulation of GRETH Legacy Network Driver in [RTEMS-SIS](https://gitlab.rtems.org/rtems/tools/rtems-sis), after a long wait. 
    
    + First I started ```lxcbr0``` bridge in one terminal and start SIS in another terminal, ```ttcpshell01.exe``` being generated after building [RTEMS Net Services](https://gitlab.rtems.org/rtems/pkg/rtems-net-services/-/tree/main?ref_type=heads).   ![Starting-SIS-terminal-for-LEON3]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/posts/week3/sis_start_leon3.png)
    + But, I got this error indicating that the network stack is not able to obtain network configuration via BOOTP Protocol and hence the network device (GRETH) is not configured properly. ![BOOTP_error]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/posts/week3/BOOTP_error.png)
    + Also, unexpectedly, no tap interface was automatically created in spite of enabling GRETH. 
    ![lxcbr0_no_tap]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/posts/week3/lxcbr0_no_tap.png)
    + So, I decided to go with assigning Static IP to the GRETH Driver. Upon exploring further, I learnt that setting required configuration in ```config.inc``` file of RTEMS Net Services then building RTEMS Net Services would set this configuration in hence generated ```ttcpshell01.exe```. In addition, I decided to set configuration for GRETH Driver using custom ```rtems_bsdnet_ifconfig``` struct and ```rtems_bsdnet_config``` struct; however, on doing this, sometimes I was getting BOOTP error again in some cases, and in some other cases, different types of errors occured, one of them indicating that invalid address is present in a register. Upon checking . ![instruction_trap_error]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/posts/week3/instruction_error_sis.png)
    + Lastly, I thought of restarting my approach again so I just set the configuration in ```config.inc``` file of RTEMS Net Services and built it, avoiding using custom ```rtems_bsdnet_ifconfig``` and ```rtems_bsdnet_config``` structs...and...the shell started inside SIS where I was able to run ttcp commands!

    + ```tap0``` interface was also created successfully when TTCP was running. ![tap0_interface_created]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/posts/week3/tap0_present.png)
    + However, apparently the traffic in TTCP was too overwhelming  causing it to crash unexpectedly. So, according to the suggestion of my mentors, I am planning too check with Telnet and/or TCP Echo Server, or rather even UDP Echo Server. 


2. Continued coding for GRETH lwIP Port
    + This week, I was not able to devote much time for coding for GRETH lwIP Port
    + However I studied further studied esecially memory mapping for GRETH.

3. Created Blog post for current week (Week-3)

## Plans for next week
----------------------------------
1. Explore options for TCP Echo Server / Telnet / UDP Server for GRETH Legacy Networking Driver Simulation
2. Create blogs till Week-4 by end of week
3. Continue on GRETH lwIP Code
