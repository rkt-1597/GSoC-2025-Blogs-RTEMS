## Overview
-------------------------------
This week is the first week working with RTEMS as a GSoC Contributor. this week lies in the Community Bonding Period - a time when we start diving deeper into the codebase of our project and become more familiar with it. This week, I majorly studied existing [GRETH Network Driver in RTEMS Legacy Networking Stack](https://gitlab.rtems.org/rtems/pkg/rtems-net-legacy/-/blob/main/bsps/shared/net/greth2.c?ref_type=heads)


## Work completed this week
----------------------------------

1. Studied the [GRETH Network Driver in RTEMS Legacy Networking Stack](https://gitlab.rtems.org/rtems/pkg/rtems-net-legacy/-/blob/main/bsps/shared/net/greth2.c?ref_type=heads) in detail :
    
    + GRETH Hardware initialization
    + Working of some of the registers of PHY and GRETH MAC (Media Access Controller)
    + Autonegotiation process
    + GRETH Interrupt Handler
    + Relationship between memory buffers and ring descriptors as well as their working
    + Packet transmission and reception mechanism in the driver

2. Created Doxygen comments for all the functions of this GRETH Driver at [my fork of Legacy Networking Package](https://gitlab.rtems.org/prithvi77/rtems-net-legacy/-/blob/v7-updates/bsps/shared/net/greth2.c?ref_type=heads) as well as a [Doxyfile](https://gitlab.rtems.org/prithvi77/rtems-net-legacy/-/blob/v7-updates/Doxyfile?ref_type=heads), currently only for GRETH driver for simplicity and organizaion for creating GRETH specific documentation.

This week mostly was a study phase for my project.

## Plans for next week
----------------------------------
1. Study [RTEMS lwIP Package](https://gitlab.rtems.org/rtems/pkg/rtems-lwip) in depth
2. Create blogs till Week-1
