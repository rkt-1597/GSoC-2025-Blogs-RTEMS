## Overview
-------------------------------
This week, I completed the following tasks :
+ Worked on coding for various sections of Initilaization of GRETH lwIP Driver
+ Worked on testing Telnet from RTEMS Net Services on SIS for testing Legacy GRETH Driver functionality

## Work completed this week
----------------------------------

1. Worked on coding for various sections of Initilaization of GRETH lwIP Driver. 
    
    + Added [Draft MR](https://gitlab.rtems.org/rtems/pkg/rtems-lwip/-/merge_requests/22) for the code I create for GRETH lwIP Port for GSoC 2025
    + Added functions for MDIO Read, MDIO Write and MDIO Initialization in `greth_mdio.h`
    + Added function for GRETH Driver Initialization `EMACInit()` in `greth_emac.h`
    + Added fucntion `greth_init_buffer_descriptors()` for initializing buffer descriptors used in the communication process, `almalloc()` for allocation of memory aligned to a specific value, `greth_rx_buffer_refill()` for amking packet buffers available for packet reception and `greth_hw_set_addr()` for setting GRETH MAC Address, all in `greh_netif.c`.
    + Added fucntions for PHY Reset, and Autonegotiation in `greth_phy.c`
    + Added a new file `greth_netif.h` which has function declarations which are useful for debugging purposes.
    + Added function `EMACMACSrcAddrSet()` in `greth_emac.h` for setting GRETH MAC Address.
    + Added `leon3.json` file which will help building RTEMS lwIP Package for sparc/leon3 BSP.

2. New approaches considered in GRETH lwIP Driver as compared to GRETH Legacy Driver as well as TMS570 lwIP Driver considered as example:
    + Used same struct `emac_bd` for both transmit and receive buffer descriptors, since they share the same fields
    + Added fields `num_tx_bd` and `num_rx_bd` in struct `greth_netif_struct` for setting the number of transmit and receive buffer descriptors separately.
    + Set size of `buffptr` field in `emac_bd` to 32 bits.
    + Moved struct `phy_dev_info` and GRETH MII Register Macros from `greth.h` to `greth_phy.h`
    + Added few related filds like PHY address, PHY status and PHY control variables to struct `phy_dev_info`.

3. Tried testing Telnet on RTEMS SIS for simulation of GRETH Legacy Driver
    + I had a virtual bridge (network switch) `lxcbr0` and when SIS starts it creates a virtual GRETH ethernet network interface `tap0` which connects to `lxcbr0`. To complete the network, I created a virtual ethernet cable having 2 ends (virtual network interfaces) : `veth-lxc` connected to `lxcbr0` and `veth-prithvi` connected to the host.
    + However, using `telnetd01.exe` from RTEMS Net Services, and on running  
    `>>> sudo ./sis -leon3 -bridge lxcbr0 ./telnetd01.exe -v`  
    I got an error indicating Trap 7 (memory address not aligned) ![Trap_7_Error]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/posts/week4/trap7_err.png)
    + For investigating why the trap occured, I checked using  
    `>>> sparc-rtems7-objdump -d telnetd01.exe | grep 40017694`  
    (because at that time Program Counter was at `0x40017694`) and got  
    `>>> 40017694:    c2 00 80 00     ld  [ %g2 ], %g1`  
    which indicates loading a 32-bit word from memory address at register `%g2`, to register `%g1`. Register `%g2` contained `0x400d800e` which is not a 4-byte aligned address, causing the trap error. This error occured as soon as I started telnet client on my host.
    + So I tried using `-Wcast-align -Wstrict-aliasing` flags in the waf build system (in `wscript` file for RTEMS repository) for resolvng the memory alignment issues and rebuilt `sparc/leon3` BSP, but the error persisted.
    + Next I used `addr2line` as  
    `>>> addr2line -e telnetd01.exe  0x40017694`  
    which translates program address `0x40017694` in the executable `telnetd01.exe` to corresponding source file name and line number; from this I obtained  
    `>>> ~/quick-start/rtems/7/sparc-rtems7/leon3/rtems-net-legacy/machine/in_cksum.h:193`  
    The code was related to a fucntion for calculating IP Header checksum for IPv4 packet on SPARC Architecture; however the IP Header used was not at a 4-byte aligned memory location causing the trap error.
    + For this I used `posix_memalign((void**)&ip, 4, sizeof(struct ip))` by using `RTEMS_POSIX_API = True` option in `config.ini` in RTEMS repository and rebuilding `sparc/leon3` BSP ![Using posix_memalign()]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/posts/week4/posix_addition.png)  
    to allocate a block of 4-byte aligned block of memory for the IP header and this resolved the trap 7 error and hence, now SIS and the telnet server on it didn't crash.
    + However, now, upon running this command  
    `>>> telnet 10.0.3.2 23`  
    which means create a Telnet Client session to connect to de`10.0.3.2` on TCP Port 23 (default telnet port); however, the client just kept trying until it closed the session due to timeout.
    + To verify if correct IP Address was being used to connect to in the telnet client I printed the IP address being used using the function   
    `void print_ip1(void) { `  
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`printf("RTEMS IP address: %s\n", ifcfg.ip_address); `  
    `}`
    + This gave me the IP address which I had configured for GRETH while building RTEMS Net Services : `10.0.3.2`; also, I added a `printf("legacy stack initialization successful\n");` statement for verifying if legacy networking stack was initialized correctly in corresponding `net_start()` function at `rtems-net-services/net/legacy/net_adapter.c`, and it was initialized correctly. ![greth_self_ip_chk]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/posts/week4/greth_self_ip_chk.png)
    
## Plans for next week
----------------------------------
1. Debug Telnet Server-Client connection issue for GRETH Legacy Driver
2. Continue on GRETH lwIP Code
3. Create blogs till Week-5
