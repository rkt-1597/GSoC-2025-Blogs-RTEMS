## Overview
-------------------------------
This week is the second week working with RTEMS as a GSoC Contributor. The initial portion of this week lies in the Community Bonding Period while the latter portion lie in Coding Period of GSoC. This week, I completed the following tasks :
+ Studying some core functions of TMS570 Ethernet lwIP Driver as well as documenting them using Doxygen and Doxyfile
+ Successfully deployed blog site
+ Finalized midterm deliverables with all the mentors

## Work completed this week
----------------------------------

1. Studied the TMS570 Ethernet Driver in RTEMS lwIP Networking Stack [(my fork)](https://gitlab.rtems.org/prithvi77/rtems-lwip/-/blob/TMS570_lwIP_Documentation/rtemslwip/tms570/tms570_netif.c?ref_type=heads) in detail and created [Doxyfile](https://gitlab.rtems.org/prithvi77/rtems-lwip/-/blob/TMS570_lwIP_Documentation/Doxyfile?ref_type=heads), currently only for TMS570 Ethernet driver, for simplicity and organizaion for creating TMS570 Ethernet Driver specific documentation. This week I studied important functions of TMS570 Ethernet Driver, focusing on their internal working. I studied the following aspects of the driver : 
    + TMS570 Ethernet Driver initialization
    + TMS570 Ethernet Driver Interrupt Handling Mechanism
    + PHY initialization
    + TMS570 Hardware Initialization
    + Autonegotiation
    + Buffer Descriptors and their allocation and usage
    + Packet Transmission Mechanism
    + Packet reception mechanism

2. Deployed my blog using GitHub pages and Jekyll. It was a new framework for me, and I faced quite a few errors like :
    + Conflicts in verions of Ruby, ruby-build plugin and bundler 
    + Errors in gitHub actions workflow - depreceated action versions
    + Images not being displayed on the hosted blogsite due to not using `{{site.baseurl}}` properly in image references
However, resolving them all I deployed the blog site successfully.

3. Finalized midterm goals for GSoC with all the mentors and decided that by the time of midterm evaluation, the code for : 
    + GRETH Driver Initialization
    + GRETH Driver capable of transmitting packets

## Plans for next week
----------------------------------
1. Debug [RTEMS-SIS](https://gitlab.rtems.org/rtems/tools/rtems-sis) for being able to simulate GRETH Legacy Networking Driver on it
2. Create blogs till Week-2
