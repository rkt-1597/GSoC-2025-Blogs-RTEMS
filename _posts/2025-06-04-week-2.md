## Overview
-------------------------------
This week is the second week working with RTEMS as a GSoC Contributor. The initial portion of this week lies in the Community Bonding Period while the latter portion lie in Coding Period of GSoC. This week, I completed the following tasks :
1. Studying some core functions of TMS570 Ethernet lwIP Driver as well as documenting them using Doxygen
2. Created a Doxyfile for Doxygen documentation generation
2. Successfully deployed blog site
3. Finalized midterm deliverables with all the mentors

## Work completed this week
----------------------------------

+ Studied the [TMS570 Ethernet Driver in RTEMS lwIP Networking Stack](https://gitlab.rtems.org/prithvi77/rtems-lwip/-/blob/TMS570_lwIP_Documentation/rtemslwip/tms570/tms570_netif.c?ref_type=heads) in detail :
    This week I studied important functions of TMS570 Ethernet Driver, focusing on their internal working. I studied the following aspects of the driver : 
    1. TMS570 Ethernet Driver initialization
    2. TMS570 Ethernet Driver Interrupt Handling Mechanism
    3. PHY initialization
    4. TMS570 Hardware Initialization
    5. Autonegotiation
    6. Buffer Descriptors and their allocation and usage
    7. Packet Transmission Mechanism
    8. Packet reception mechanism

+ I also created Doxygen comments for several of the functions of TMS570 Ethernet Driver at [my fork of lwIP Networking Package](https://gitlab.rtems.org/prithvi77/rtems-lwip/-/blob/TMS570_lwIP_Documentation/rtemslwip/tms570/tms570_netif.c?ref_type=heads) as well as a [Doxyfile](https://gitlab.rtems.org/prithvi77/rtems-lwip/-/blob/TMS570_lwIP_Documentation/Doxyfile?ref_type=heads), currently only for TMS570 Ethernet driver, for simplicity and organizaion for creating TMS570 Ethernet Driver specific documentation.

+ Deployed my blog using GitHub pages and Jekyll. It was a new framework for me, and I faced quite a few errors like :
    1. Conflicts in verions of Ruby, ruby-build plugin and bundler 
    2. Errors in gitHub actions workflow - depreceated action versions
    3. Images not being displayed on the hosted blogsite due to not using `{{site.baseurl}}` properly in image references
However, resolving them all I deployed the blog site successfully.

+ Finalized midterm goals for GSoC with all the mentors and decided that by the time of midterm evaluation, the code for : 
    1. GRETH Driver Initialization
    2. GRETH Driver capable of transmitting packets

## Plans for next week
----------------------------------
1. Debug [RTEMS-SIS](https://gitlab.rtems.org/rtems/tools/rtems-sis) for being able to simulate GRETH Legacy Networking Driver on it
2. Create blogs till Week-2
